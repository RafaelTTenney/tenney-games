ok, i want you to make sure the data is enterin the table, not just the local storage. also, the variable acess-level should be access-level. please think deeply about my problem 


thhe following came up when i tried to sign up as a test: 

Could not find the table 'public.HighScores' in the schema cache. Double-check the HighScores table exists and the column names match (id, username, acess-level).

the following was in the console:
