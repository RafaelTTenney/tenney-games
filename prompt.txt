ok, there are some weird artifacts, and please make sure there are no problems with the games, you changed the basic functions of the sentinel-grid. which i didnt want changed. i will again give you the list of changes. please make sure all are acconmplished and all the games function smoothly:
the following changes will be to the tower defence games:
- all games
1. move to the same pop up window style as the rest of the site while keeping the controls where they  are
- citadel-grid.js
1. the game is fully functioning
2. needs a larger play area and making sure the controls are well organized and the towwer purchase selectors need to be in the window
- vector-valley.js
1. need to add easy, medium, and hard mode menu with the path having more twists and turns for easier game modes
2. again, larger play area
3. tower placing should allow user to place multiple towers of the same type without having to select the tower again betweeen each placement
4. needs better visuals, should surprise users * enemies should look better
- neon-citadel.js
1. much more stunning visuals and game flow
2. enemies that arent just circles and squares
3. it should have more than just basic graphics 
* towers and enemies should look cooler/ moer real
4. smaller grid square size while enlaging the game area
5. complex game mechanichs and strategy
6. this will be the flagship, and since the basic game citadel-grid is almost 600 lines i expect this to be well over 1000 lines to accomodate the advanced graphics and game mechanics
* i dont want anything to be simplified, this is the flagship and should be advanced
7. this should have visuals surperior to any other game
8. enemies have different rout calculations based on type
* more powerful take route of least damage/resistance
* others shortest
* others accumulate and mob rush
* ect.
9.enmies maybe are resistent to differnt defence towers based on type
10. enmies are able to attack and destroy defence towers
11. at the end of each wave there should be a "boss"
* very powerful

* large reward for defeating
12. different enemy types have different amounts/rewards based on types
13. tower abilities(eg. range, health, range, etc.) are upgraded seperately
14. possible enemy dodging
